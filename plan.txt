VERSION 0.0.0

-----

WORKING ON-

    -x 0.0.1- compile a list of relavant shader language functions

NEEDED-

-----

x- c++ generate file with random shader language functions

    x- compile a list of relavant functions
        x- measure speed (?)
    x- generate random function given weight and bias
    x- write into a file

-----

x- c++ create file type for changing the generator neural network

    x- get state of the network
        x- make that work with edge cases
    x- write state out in file

-----

x- c++ method of measuring distance to poly mesh given 3d point

    x- get point distance to tri
        x- figure out negative values
        x- test edge cases
    x- repeat over small distance in AABB volume
        x- no volume, full volume, disconnected surfaces
    x- make into compute shader (?)

-----

x- python compare the difference between generator output and tri mesh

    x- loop through the volume of the AABB, get distance from both sdf's
    x- alter neural network, optimizing for smallest difference
        x- learn methods for regressing nn

-----

x- parser from neural net file type to shader code

-----

GOAL- pipeline for converting input poly meshes into signed distance functions
